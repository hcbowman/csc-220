1. What command did you use to extract this tar file?
I used "tar xf midtermpractice.tar." "x" is used to specify the mode, extraction, and "f" is used to specify the name of the TAR archive, upon which we are preforming the action.


2. List all the files/directories in the most recently created directory.  What command did you use to find the most recent directory?  Include sample output of the directory listing.
tar tvf midtermpractice.tar | grep ^d | head -n1
ls -ltr | grep ^d | tail -n1
