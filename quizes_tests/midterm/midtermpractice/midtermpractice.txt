1. What command did you use to extract this tar file?
I used "tar xf midtermpractice.tar." "x" is used to specify the mode, extraction, and "f" is used to specify the name of the TAR archive, upon which we are preforming the action.


2. List all the files/directories in the most recently created directory.  What command did you use to find the most recent directory?  Include sample output of the directory listing.
tar tvf midtermpractice.tar | grep ^d | head -n1
ls -ltr | grep ^d | tail -n1

3. Find the file file30 using a UNIX command.  What command did you use?  What are the contents of that file?

find ./midtermpractice -name file30 -exec cat {} +
You found it.


4. Find midpractice.c & the compile warnings/errors in midpractice.c.  List what changes you had to make.  Give sample output.
/* Print the first N multiples of the number entered */
I had to change the function "multiple" to an int and return ret. for the pointer arithmatic i had to do *(b+ii) to fill 
the array, it was inccorect becuase it was not derefrencing the pointer.

Enter a number
9
The multiples of 9 are : 0 9 18 27 36 45 54 63 72


#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int multiple(int a, int b)
{	
	int ret;
	ret = a * b;
	return ret;
}

int main()
{
   int a, *b;
   int ii, y;


   printf("Enter a number\n");
   scanf("%d",&a);  

   b = (int *) malloc(a);

   /* Fill array b using pointer arithmetic */
   for (ii=0; ii<a; ii++) {
	   y = multiple(a,ii);
	   *(b + ii) = y;
	   
	}
   
   
   
   /* Print array b using array indexing */
   printf ("The multiples of %d are : ",a);
   for (ii=0; ii<a; ii++) {
	   printf("%d ",b[ii]);
	   
   }
   
   return (0);
}
